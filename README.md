# Heart-Disease-Analysis
Health is real wealth in the pandemic time we all realized the brute effects of COVID-19 on all
irrespective of status. We are required to analyze this health and medical data for better
future preparation.
Do ETL: Extract- Transform and Load data from the heart disease diagnostic database
We can perform EDA through Python. The database extracts various information such as
Heart disease rates, Heart disease by gender, by age.
We can even compare attributes of the data set to extract necessary information. Make the
necessary dashboard with the best we can extract from the data. Using various visualizations
and features to make the best dashboard
Find key metrics and factors and show the meaningful relationships between attributes.
